# Self Evaluation

- ### I would say when it comes to for loops my confidence is about a 5/10. I surely need to do some more research on the subject and practice more, but I know that I can do it if I apply myself. Thankfully the general concepts of for loops are built upon things I do have a good understand of, so I am excited for when it does all come together.
- ### It felt a little daunting at first to realize I would need to find my own solutions to most of the problems in this assignment, but it was also kind of a nice and challenging change. Most of today has been challenging, but fun. There was productive and unproductive struggle throughout this assignment, but I would say a large majority of it was productive.
- ### I need to go back and learn more of the vocabulary terms we have learned throughout the course so I can use them when I am asking questions. I know it will be beneficial to know what words I need to use to either explain or get help with something. I know I will need a refresher on for loops amongst other things we have learned, but I will do it on my down time after Mod 0.
- ### I will get the answers I need through reviewing my notes, finding my own resources through the internet, reviewing course work I didn't fully retain, but mostly, my peers who have a strong grasp on the subjects I am struggling on. I think I did a really good job of asking proper questions to my peers today through slack huddles and DMs.
